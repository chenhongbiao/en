### Abstract

### Editor's evaluation

This study presents a major technical advance by recording from genetically identifed neurons in freely moving mice. This method is applied to the hippocampus to determine circuit specifc synaptic interaction in vivo and to compare behavioral correlates of genetically-defned cell types. This technique paves the way for future studies aiming to relate genetics, circuits, and neuronal coding in freely moving animals.
