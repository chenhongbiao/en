Good evening, my name is Chen Hongbiao. You can call me Cat. 

There is no doubt that the development of the Internet has made our lives more convenient than ever before, but it also has brought some problems.

>In 2013, QQ was found that more than 70 million data had leaked on the Internet.
>In 2014, 12306 website was accused that about 130 thousand personal information had been public.
>Last month, NetEase 163 mail had a big deal. Over 100 million 163 emails were hacked.

Since my major is computer science and technology and I have been interested in hacking skills for over three years, tonight, I would like to share something related to it. - *Internet Security*

According to the data breach investigations report, in 2015, 700 million personal records were stolen, sold, and made public by crackers. Crackers are bad hackers. Hackers work for skills and fun, while crackers work for money. They like to steal your network information and ruin it. Because the number of crackers has increased in recent years, the Internet has become more and more dangerous.

So how can we protect our computers from crackers?

`(Well) I think the best way to learn how to defend is to learn how to attack.` Once you know how crackers steal your data, you can avoid it. So I am going to tell you two common ways to steal other information in our daily life. Let us start password first.

### Password

Password, the only identification on the virtual world, from QQ to online bank, we use it everywhere. Obviously, it is very important, but it could be fragile if you are careless. If you want to crack other passwords, what should you do? It's easier than you think.

1. The first thing you can do is to try some default passwords which are set by system, such as admin, 1234, or 0000. Ridiculously? Yes, but it is very effective.  Believe it or not, more than half of the people never change their passwords, because they are so lazy. Lazy, is one key to crack passwords.
2. If you are unlucky, the next step is to try weak password. By contrast with the strong password, weak password is easy to remember and guess. As the picture shows, here are some common weak password. By using the specific software, you can guess the password over Ten million times in one second.
3. Fail again? Do not worry, let us try to crack his/her other accounts first, especially the unimportant accounts. Once you get one account password, you can apply a hacker skill called library crash for obtaining his/her other accounts. Because people are likely to use the same or similar password at different sites.

For example, I suppose your Wechat password is the same as your QQ password. Yeah? 
Got it? Remember the principle is that people are Lazy. Let us move on to Wi-Fi.

### Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi could be dangerous, too. When you think you are lucky to have a free Wi-Fi, maybe someone are spying on your information through the Free Wi-Fi.

- To do that, first, set a free Wi-Fi hotspot named CMCC or NEU.
- And wait people to connect your Wi-Fi happily, something like fishing.
- Then run a analysis tool named sniffer to catch data he send to the server so you can steal his cookies and sign in his accounts. Because most people always open their Wi-Fi which will lead to automatic connection, we can monitor their data and catch their information packet easily.

### Conclusion

Now you know two ways to steal information.
On the one hand, you can attack passwords through default passwords, weak password and library crash. On the other hand, you can attack Wi-Fi by building a free fishing hotspot. But don't forget our original purpose, to protect ourselves information. So the contrary ways are to set different strong passwords at different websites and to be wary of Free Wi-Fi.

Keep your eye at your personal information. Thank you!
