>She is the story. The story is she.

She always wears a brown coat and a white & black scarf. 

She has long straight hair, big clear eyes and a dazzling smile.

She is the person I miss so much. Her name is FF, and we were classmates, from primary school to high school.

Although I don't have a good memory for my childhood, I can still remember the first time we met.

It was an early autumn afternoon, just as the kapok flowers (木棉花) were beginning to fall.

When I was walking back to my house in the same way that I usually did, an unexpected person stopped me.

It's a little girl, who said she want to make friends with me, but what I noticed is another girl who came along with her. 

That's a beautiful face that I would never forget. 

Her eyes, framed by long lashes, were bright and seemed to brighten any darkness in the world.

Her lips, under a straight nose, were soft pink and seemed to speak all words of kindness. 

And a small mole, which was right on her cheek, made everything perfect and made her look like an angel. 

That's a lucky day of my life to meet such an angel called FF.

Soon after, we were together. We went to school together. We studied together. And we went back home together.

Although FF and I were both quiet people who didn't talk too much, we knew each other little by little.

The things we did were ordinary but the time we spent was precious, as my purest and happiest time.

Just by looking at her face, I would have a wonderful feeling of peace as if I were in a different world.

Just by listening to her voice, I would have enormous courage to face any shadow that blocked my way.

Maybe she doesn't realize how powerful she is for me, but the fact is that because of her, my heart is alive.

However, unlike fairy tale s where stories always have a happy ending, I messed things up. 

What a terrible mistake! She is so special to me but I made her sad, annoyed and even unhappy.

Inevitably, we were apart and went separate ways.

It's a long time, about five years, not to see FF.

If I meet her again, I would say "Thank you, Thank you for any of the good times we shared. Sorry, Sorry for all the stupid things I did." and I would tell her all interesting things I had in my university life.

But now, I just miss her, deeply.
