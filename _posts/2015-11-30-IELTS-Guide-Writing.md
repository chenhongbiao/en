## Introduction

- Always Plan your answer before writing.
  - If it's possible, check your answer after writing.
- Spend more time on Task 2 (40min).
  - I decided to write Task 2 first, because it spend more time to clam down and think.
  - It really does not matter which task you write first. 

- Read the question carefully.
  - You should respond to exactly what the question asks you.
- Don’t write too little.
  - But don't be panic if your writing amount is not enough.
  - Begin to get an idea of how many words you normally write on one line. 
- Don’t write too much.
  - The examiner is looking for quality, not quantity! If you have more time, check the grammar.
