>Every story should have an ending.

What she saw was a young man, standing still in the moonlight. He was tall and thin, with silver hair, wearing a white cloak which swept the ground. 
He had a handsome face but a pair of cat's ears on his head.

After a moment of silence, he said with a slight smile, "At last, we meet, Keeper." 

"Keeper? Why he called dad Keeper? Keep what?" Although Riya was still afraid, her curiosity outweighed the fear.

Riya's father didn't smile. Instead, his face became grave, "Long time no see, old friend. I guess you were here because of her," he said slowly.

"Old friend? With a young man? But I've never heard dad mentioned him. And who is she?" Riya got confused and became more curious.

"Exactly. So, do you still want to stop me, or run?" the man replied, fixing Riya's father with a hostile stare.

"No. You win this time. I will let you in. And you can take what you want, if you can," said Riya's father. 
Then he turned around and said towards the sofa, "Riya, come here."

"Whaaaat!" Riya exclaimed in her heart but didn't come out.

"Wise choice," said the man and then walked straight to the direction of Riya.

Suddenly! The man produced a sword from his cloak and chopped to Riya fiercely.
However, his sword was bounced off a green light and cut his head open!

"Dream?" Riya asked herself, being shocked by what she saw.

"No. That is true, "said the man and took the sword out of his head without blood.

"Okay, I know it weren’t that simple," the man sighed and sat down near Riya.

"Listen, since we have no time, I’ll come straight to the point – Alice, in order to save the world, you must…"

"Wait, Wait! You called me Alice?" Riya interrupted the man.

"Yes, yes, your name is Alice. My name is Faust. Just listen to me, and you will understand everything. We have no more time," Faust replied impatiently.
"Alice, our world is a story written by a boy called Chen for his coursework. In other words, we are just the characters living in an essay that only exists in the Chen's brain. Everything here is his imagination which reflects his thoughts. If we could not find the exit before the story finish, we will disappear forever. So I need your help, Alice," Faust said quickly.

"No. Nonsense! I can't believe it," said Alice. 

"Look at your name now, called Alice instead of Riya. This story is limited by 800 words, so please, we have no more words," shouted Faust.

"Why me?" murmured Alice.

"I represent his logical thinking. And you represent love in his mind, which can strongly influence his behavior. If you died as a heroine, we can mess up the author so that the world will be out of his control and escape his imagination," Faust talked excitedly.

"Dad? Did you hear what he said? Dad?" Alice’s voice shook.

"That's enough, Faust. If you cannot persuade her, please leave...” said Keeper.

"Shut up!" said Faust violently as his hand was sticking into Keeper’s body which was getting grey immediately and turned into nothing eventually.
"I should have killed you at the beginning, but you survived due to the protection of Keeper. Now I am stronger than Keeper," Faust shook his head and said, "But as you was growing up, you're getting so powerful that I cannot destroy you directly. So you need to kill yourself, or this world will fade away."

It all happened so fast. After a while, Alice just realized that her dad is gone.

Then she closed her eyes and fell to the ground, sobbing bitterly.

When Alice was crying, the world was breaking.

Faust had no way but wait.

Gradually, Alice calmed down.

"I'm the image of FF. Here is Chen's spiritual world, a mad world," Alice said quietly.

"Yeah. It seems that you recalled who you are," said Faust.

"Well, I have all her memory," said Alice.

"Luckily, we are almost at the ending of this story, Hurry up, you can…" said Faust.

"Yeah. I must hurry," said Alice as she was sticking her hand into Faust’s body, "Every story should have an ending."
"Believe it or not, the person who killed you isn’t me, is the author," said Alice coldly.
