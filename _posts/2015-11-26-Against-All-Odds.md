> This is my first formal public speaking as an ice break.

Good evening everyone! My name is Chen Hong Biao. You can call me Cat.

I am a Chinese student, majoring computer science at Northeastern university. I am going to tell you a game about me. I have played this game for over ten years and I would like to share my experience with you. I am sure you will enjoy it.

Since I was born in a remote village, I went to school two years later than other children. I was level 0 when I met other Lv2 classmates at primary school, Grade 5. Level refers to the rank of English. It can be roughly counted by how many years you have studied English. For example, I am Lv10 now and my English teacher is probably Lv 20. And because I was a total newbie at that time, (I had never hear English before â€“ and knew nothing about it), my first fight was a nightmare. 30 points was my first English score. 

Luckily, I met a Great Sorceress (my first English teacher) who taught me how to fight from ABC to one two three. After learning English for two years, I succeeded in my graduation test by playing the role of a swordsman. Leveled up and went to middle school.

**Why am I a sword man but not a wizard?**

Because using a Memory Sword (just copying English) is easier than using a Logic Magic (understanding English).

Anyway, in middle school, I used my sword to combat countless monsters. Yes, it worked very well. And then, in my high school, I found a companion. His name is Bee. Without Bee, I could not go through the 6-year quest for knowledge. I will never forget the time when I learnt vocabulary with him. That was amazing. Finally, I defeated my first Boss (GaoKao) and came to this school.

But in college, when I was fighting with a new monster (CET-6), I realized I had missed something important. I was not able to attack flying creatures. My broken English grammar limited me. So I decided to make a new weapon (Grammar Bow), using 400 pieces of paper, 4 guide books and a little Magic. The bow can help me shoot any dragons which I had never found before. It fixed my mistakes.

However, I still failed in the Big War (IELTS). This dragon found my speaking weakness and threw me into a deep hole. My fear and nervousness betrayed me. It prevented me from speaking English proudly. The less I spoke, the more I feared. The more I feared, the less I spoke. I was beaten by myself but I am find. It is time to make some changes. Now I am making a suit of Confidence Armor, which will help me kill the dragon in the future.

This has been my English Road. Learn knowledge, find problems, fight it and Level up. 

>It was a bittersweet journey.

Three things I have learnt:

- First: Try to understand English instead of memorizing it. Magic is always better than a sword.
- Second: Try to find a partner with you. My friend Bee always keeps me warm on the trip.
- Third: Don't be afraid. The only thing you have to fear is yourself. If you believe in yourself, nothing can stop you. `Against All Odds.` 

Thank you!
